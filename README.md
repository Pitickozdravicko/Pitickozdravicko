# Hi, I'm Petr

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering** from Tomas Bata University in Zlín.  
By day, I’m a **web developer**—by night (and weekends), a **hobbyist game developer**.  

I enjoy building all sorts of applications and products, whether it’s something practical or something experimental. I like to see the results of my work, and I’ll admit that my perfectionism sometimes makes me push a bit too far for the "perfect" outcome—both a strength and a challenge, depending on the context.

### What I work with
**When making webs**  
- React(TypeScript / JavaScript)  
- Go  
- PostgreSQL  
- Redis  

**Some crazy game stuff** 
- C#, C++, gdscript
- Unreal Engine  
- Godot  

---

### My interests
- Game development: I enjoy strategy games and roguelike designs in the style of *The Binding of Isaac*. These are the kinds of projects I’d love to explore more deeply.  
- Web development: I’m interested in building meaningful applications—anything that provides real value, helps me grow, and contributes to my long-term development as a software engineer.

### Things I have, but sometimes I wish I did not
- A little bit of insanity
- Milions (totally accurate number ;) ) of redone/undone lines of code (because every programmer should have some)
- Excellent skills in searching internet/webs, watching tutorials and reading docs *quite crying sounds*

### Get in touch
If you’re interested in working with me, feel free to reach out and we can get started right away.
