# Hi, I'm Petr

I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering** from Tomas Bata University in Zlín.  
By day, I’m a **web developer**—by night (and weekends), a **hobbyist game developer**.  

I enjoy building all sorts of applications and products, whether it’s something practical or something experimental. I like to see the results of my work, and I’ll admit that my perfectionism sometimes makes me push a bit too far for the "perfect" outcome—both a strength and a challenge, depending on the context.

### What I work with
**Web development (main focus):**  
- TypeScript / JavaScript  
- Go  
- PostgreSQL  
- Redis  

**Game development (for fun):**  
- Unreal Engine  
- Godot  

---

### My interests
- Game development: I enjoy strategy games and roguelike designs in the style of *The Binding of Isaac*. These are the kinds of projects I’d love to explore more deeply.  
- Web development: I’m interested in building meaningful applications—anything that provides real value, helps me grow, and contributes to my long-term development as a software engineer.
